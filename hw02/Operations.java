 * CS 2110 Fall 2018 HW2
 * Part 3 - Coding with bitwise operators
 *
 * @author YOUR NAME HERE
 *
 * Global rules for this file:
 * - All of these functions must be completed in ONE statement. That means they should be
 *   of the form "return [...];", with a single semicolon. No partial credit will be
 *   awarded for any Method that isn't completed with one statement.
 *
 * - You may not use more than 2 conditionals per method, which for this file would
 *   just be ternary expressions. Boolean expressions outside of ternary expressions do
 *   not count toward this sum.
 * - You may not declare any variables.
 * - You may not use casting.
 * - You may not use the unsigned right shift operator (>>>)
 * - You may not write any helper methods, or call any other method from this or
 *   another file to implement any method.
 * - In functions where addition or subtraction is allowed, you may only do so
 *   with the number 1.
 *
 * Method-specific rules for this file:
 * - You may not use multiplication, division or modulus in any method.
 * - You may not use addition, subtraction, or conditionals in setShort,
 *   getByte, bitRange, pack, or xnor.
 * - You may not use bitshifting or the exclusive OR operator (^) in xnor.
 *
 * Finally, your code must be robust and concise. If we asked you to print out the values 1 through 100
 * and you wrote 100 separate print statements, then sure, it works, but no one's gonna hire a coder who does
 * that. Likewise, you will NOT get credit for verbose answers for which there is a much more concise
 * solution. For instance, if you need to shift a value by n*4 times, you may not write x << n << n << n << n
 * or you will get no credit, because there is a much more concise way to do this in only two operations by
 * first shifting n. Keep this in mind, ESPECIALLY in the first 2 functions in this file.
 *
 * Remember that for this assignment, All bit masks must be written in hexadecimal.
 * This is the convention for masks and makes it much easier for the programmer to
 * understand the code. If you write a mask in any other base you will lose points.
 *
 * All of these functions accept ints as parameters because if you pass in a number
 * (which is of type int by default) into a Method accepting a byte, then the Java
 * compiler will complain even if the number would fit into that type.
 *
 * Now, keep in mind the return value is also an int. Please read the comments about how
 * many significant bits to return and make sure that the other bits are not set or else
 * you will not get any points for that test case.
 * i.e if I say to return 6 bits and you return 0xFFFFFFFF, you will lose points.
 *
 * Definitions of types:
 * nibble - 4 bits
 * byte   - 8 bits
 * short  - 16 bits
 * int    - 32 bits
