     * if a button is still down.

     * that VBlank is processed once per frame. Use the vBlankCounter variable

     *
     * TA-TODO: VERY IMPORTANT! READ THIS PART.
     * You need to perform all calculations on the currentAppState passed to you,
     * and perform all state updates on the nextAppState state which we define below
     * and return at the end of the function. YOU SHOULD NOT MODIFY THE CURRENTSTATE.
     * Modifying the currentAppState will mean the undraw function will not be able
     * to undraw it later.
